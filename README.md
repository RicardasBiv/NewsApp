# NewsApp
NewsApp is my first application which is created by using Jetpack Compose. It uses <a href="https://newsapi.org" rel="nofollow">NewsAPI</a> to get top headlines.<br />
###  Project contains:<br />
- MVVM Architecture
- Jetpack Compose
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Dagger Hilt
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Coil
- Firebase crashlytics
- Firebase Analytics
- LeakCanary(not really useful in small project)

## Setup
- First you will need Api key from <a href="https://newsapi.org" rel="nofollow">NewsAPI</a>.
- Then that key you must put in local.properties file as API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE".<br />
- Also you will need google-services.json file and you can get it from https://console.firebase.google.com <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com " rel="nofollow">FirebaseConsole</a>. You will need to create new project and add that .json to app folder.
