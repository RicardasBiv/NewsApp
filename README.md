# NewsApp
NewsApp is my first application that is created using Jetpack Compose. It uses <a href="https://newsapi.org" rel="nofollow">NewsAPI</a> to get top headlines.<br />
###  Project contains:<br />
- MVVM Architecture
- Jetpack Compose
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Dagger Hilt
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Coil
- Firebase crashlytics
- Firebase Analytics
- LeakCanary(not really useful in small project)
